# Intermediate_projects2
Consists of two basic games built using python 3 **object oriented programming**.
## ping_pong
We all have heard of the famous ping pong game, in our version we have to user who can play against each other using specific keys on the keyboard to move
their respective paddles. The goal is to keep playing until one of the player misses to hit the ball and looses one point. As soon as a player looses one 
point the game restarts. The speed of the ball increases with each hit to make the game interesting and the score keeps updating as the game continues.
## turtle_crossing
This game is a single player game in which the user controls a turtle to move in only one direction which is up (south to north on the screen). The goal is 
to reach the other end while looking out and avoiding getting hit by cars (blocks) that are randomly generated using the **random module** moving from the 
right end to the left side of the screen. As soon as the player finishes the turtle goes back its initial position and the level (displayed on the screen)
increases which basically increases the speed of the cars.
